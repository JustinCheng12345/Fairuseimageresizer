Requirement:
1. This script require Python Wikimedia Bot Freamwork.

Process:
1. Input a list or one image.
2. Retuen null if ogg/svg given.
3. Check number of pages which use the image, if that more than one page, return null, as a fair use image should not be used more than once.
4. Use info=image to find the width of image.
5. Purge the page to find width of image in page (No API from PWB provided.)
6. If width of image in page > image width as 50, download the thumbnail, else return null.
7. Upload the downloaded image.

Fixed bugs:
1. Can now process unicode-encoded title images, which is due to regex.

TODO:
1. Preload and download images, check same image by hash.
2. If none args given, retrive list from category directly.
